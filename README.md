# xUnit-Example-Project
A .NET Core xUnit example project to unit test a small code-base.

This repo is designed to provide an example of how the .NET Core xUnit unit testing library can be used to unit test a small code base. The repo contains the code base under which we are trying to test, along with the unit test project with all of the tests contained within. The project is deployed as an MS Solution so the project can be opened and edited in Visual Studio.
